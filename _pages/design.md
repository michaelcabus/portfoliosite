I've worked in design, writing, and technology my entire career.  Currently, in addition to my full-time job, I provide technology and design consulting for non-profits.  I designed a new web site for Little Elm Public Library recently, and am currently a technical consultant for Barbershop Books, a non-profit that connects young people to books.

## E-Commerce

I’ve developed information architecture; content strategy; and mobile designs for e-commerce brands, focused on hardware, pet supplies and organic food.

*For the organic food site for Yumza.com, I used research in e-commerce usability to redesign the product search and check-out experience; I also developed information architecture and content strategy for this and other e-commerce sites*

## Open Source Software

I’ve redesigned a software system interface, designed a kids version of the software, and designed and developed features to enhance the software experience

*For the open-source software, Koha, I redesigned the interface to create a better design and improve the functionality. This design was widely adopted by clients, and led to the acquisition of new clients.  Additionally, I did a comprehensive accessibility study of the software interface using WebAim software and made the software accessible*

*I developed and designed a kids version of Koha.  This site allows kids to select books based on categories, most popular, and book series.  I created the back-end interface as well that allows librarians to define categories, and to add book lists for summer reading and other reading programs.*

*For my thesis project in design school at Philadelphia University, I designed and developed an app centered around midwifery and pregnancy.  This continued my interest in digital medicine (in a previous semester, I worked with an industrial design student to develop an interface for products designed for home healthcare).  For this project, I did user research with midwives, developed user flows and data models, and developed a prototype in Android, using parse.io for real-time data*
